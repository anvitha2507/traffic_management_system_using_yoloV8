# traffic_management_system_using_yoloV8
**Overview**  return
This repository contains code for a Traffic Management System that employs YOLOv8 for real-time traffic object detection. The project is designed to detect various traffic elements such as vehicles which provide the class name and assign an unique ID for each vehicle providing a robust solution for monitoring and managing traffic flow.It also detects the red light violation and store the Unique ID's of violated vehicles in a file 

**Features:**
**YOLOv8 Integration:** Utilizes the YOLOv8 model for accurate and efficient object detection.  return
**Real-time Processing:** Provides real-time processing capabilities for monitoring traffic.   return
**Vehicle Classification:** Classifies detected vehicles into categories such as cars,trucks.  return
**Traffic Flow Analysis:** Analyzes traffic patterns to optimize traffic light timings and manage congestion.  return

**Requirements**   return
Python 3.x
