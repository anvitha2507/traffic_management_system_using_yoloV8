# traffic_management_system_using_yoloV8
**Overview**  
This repository contains code for a Traffic Management System that employs YOLOv8 for real-time traffic object detection. The project is designed to detect various traffic elements such as vehicles which provide the class name and assign an unique ID for each vehicle providing a robust solution for monitoring and managing traffic flow.It also detects the red light violation and store the Unique ID's of violated vehicles in a file 

**Features:**
**YOLOv8 Integration:** Utilizes the YOLOv8 model for accurate and efficient object detection. 

**Real-time Processing:** Provides real-time processing capabilities for monitoring traffic.   

**Vehicle Classification:** Classifies detected vehicles into categories such as cars,trucks.  

**Traffic Flow Analysis:** Analyzes traffic patterns to optimize traffic light timings and manage congestion.  


**Requirements**   
Python 3.x
